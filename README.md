# Lotta Chat ðŸ“±

Lotta Chat is a lightweight, privacy-focused chat app designed for iOS as part of the [lotta.schule](https://lotta.schule) project. Our goal is to provide all **lotta.schule** users with easy, on-the-go access to their messages in a secure, user-friendly environment.

This app is the iOS version, written in native Swift, and connects to the [Lotta API](https://github.com/lotta-schule/lotta) via GraphQL over WebSockets and HTTPS.

Lotta Chat also has an [Android counterpart](https://github.com/lotta-schule/android) and is available on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/lotta-nachrichten/id6468399892).

We plan to continue developing and improving these apps, working hard to honor our usersâ€™ whishes to the best of our ability within our limited resources.
